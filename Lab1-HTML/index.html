<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>

HTML5 is the fifth revision and newest version of the HTML standard. It offers new features that
provide not only rich media support but also enhance support for creating web applications that can interact with
users, their local data, and servers more easily and effectively than was previously possible. These
elements are often termed as Semantic Markup because they convey their meaning and purpose clearly to the developer
and to the browser. This article discusses some of the important HTML5 elements that can contribute to the layout of
a webpage.

<h2><strong>Semantic Markup</strong></h2>
According to Dictionary.com, semantics refers to the correct interpretation of the meaning of a word or sentence.
To use a word semantically is to use it in a way that is properly aligned with the meaning of the word.
When we misuse a word we are not using it semantically.
